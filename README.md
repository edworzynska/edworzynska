## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Ewa and I'm a Junior Java Developer with a passion for learning and exploring the world of software engineering. Here’s a little bit about me and what I’ve been working on.    



### 🌟 About Me

I'm all about:

- Java & Spring Boot for building robust backend services
- Crafting APIs and playing with databases
- Learning new tech and turning ideas into functional apps
- Combining my background in customer service with my love for coding to create seamless user experiences

When I’m not coding, you can find me playing the piano, listening to classical music, or struggling with solving another sudoku.   



### 🛠️ My Projects

#### 🐾 Pawstagram
A pet-friendly take on Instagram, where users can share, like, and comment on adorable pet photos. Backend powered by Java and Spring Boot, with AWS S3 for media storage. The frontend in React is still in the works, but you can already sign up, log in, and start posting!

#### 💳 Oyster Card System
Inspired by London's public transport system, this project lets you manage Oyster cards, top them up, and keep track of journeys. Backend in Spring Boot and frontend in Swift for iOS.

#### 🏠 BnB Booking Platform
A booking platform that helps users find and list cozy living spaces. Features include booking requests, approvals, and email notifications. Built with Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.    



### 💼 Experience

Before diving into the world of coding, I honed my problem-solving and communication skills as a Customer Service Representative and Sales Specialist. Those years taught me the importance of clear communication, attention to detail, and a user-first approach—skills I bring into my development projects every day.
